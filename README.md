ComposerSkeletonModule
======================

A Zend Framework 2 skeleton module enhanced and based on composer.

Very helpful to create a ZF2 vendor module you want to be installed and autoloaded with composer, but also compatible with standard ZF2 module loader.

Just replace what you need from composer.json file.

It includes configuration files to build the module on [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and [scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/).
